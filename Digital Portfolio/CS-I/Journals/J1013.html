<h2>1.1 Why is one of the symbols used for exclusive disjunction " "?</h2>
This symbol is used to represent exclusive disjunction because it represents that the output is true in a case when one of the inputs is true but both aren't true. The triple equal sign represents that two quantities are identical or similar to each other, so therefore thsi symbol suggets the opposite
<h2>2.1 Why is the formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table related only to the number of inputs, and why is the formula 2n?</h2>
The formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table is related to the number of inputs because the number of inputs correlates to the number of outputs that they generate, which in turn create rows containing said data. The formula is 2n because it has to do with inputs and outputs. For example, 2 inputs (or an n value of 2) in the formula would be 2^2. There are two inputs and two outputs
