<h2>1.1 What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the carry column?</h2>
The truth table that produces the output of the carry column is the AND truth table
<h2>1.2 What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Sumn Column?</h2>
The truth table that produces the output of the sum column is the XOR truth table.
<h2>2.1 What do you notice about the relationship between the first half (top four rows) of the full adder as compared to the all the rows of the half adder?</h2>
I noticed that the first half of the full adder is the same as all of the rows in the half adder.
<h2>2.2 Why is this true?</h2>
This is true because the half adder is capable of only adding two single bit binary numbers. That's why it stops at 4 rows because at row 4, the carry must be added to A and B which cannot be done with a half adder. On the other hand, the full adder is capable of adding three single bit binary numbers which include A, B, and C in.
<h2>3.1 Why does the least significant bit position use a half adder rather than a full adder?</h2>
It uses a half adder because it doesn't require three single bit binary numbers to be added together. It produces a carry output but doesn't need to add a carry input itself to the other two values because it's the first adder.
<h2>3.2 Assume that proper inputs are applied for all bits in numbers A and B. Will the correct output from S be available instantaneously? If not, why not?</h2>
Yes, the correct output from S will be available instantaneously. This is because the adder will already have the three inputs which are A and B, which are applied properly, and the third input which is the carry output. The carry output provided prior to the addition process so there won't be any delay. Since all three of these components are present at the time of the addition, S will be avaialable instantly.
<h2>3.3 Assume that we have a standard (non scientific calculator) capable of adding two 16-bit words. Two numbers, A and B, are added together. After the addition, it is noted that C^15 is high. What can we infer? What is this state commonly called?<h2>
