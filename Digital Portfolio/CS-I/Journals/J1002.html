<h1>I received assistance from nobody and assisted my shoulder mate.</h1>
<h2>1.1 Name at least two other services that you personally use which are implemented using a Client Server Model </h2>
     Two services that I personally use which are implemented using a Client Server Model are Gmail and Imessage <br>
<h2>2.1 It appears that both Jack Williams and John Williams can have a directory of the same name. Do you think the ability to have two different users create a directory of the same name is important? Why?</h2>
     Yes I believe that it's important because when renaming directories there are many common names to choose from; for example, Photos Documents and Videos are common name<br>
<h2>3.1 Why do you think the home directory has a special symbol to respresent it?</h2>
     The home directory has a special symbol to represent because it makes it makes life easier from the programmar because then they will be able to distinguish it from ot
directories.<br>
<h2>4.1 Did the prompt change? If so, how? Why is this useful?</h2>
The prompt changed because typing pwd indicates that we're now in the Merlin directory. <br>
<h2>5.1 and 5.2 What happens each time you press the arrow up or down key?</h2>
     Each time you pressed the up arrow or down key, it would reiterate the commands you typed prior.<br>
<h2>6.1 Was "Hello World" printed to the screen as before? If not, why not? What do you think happened to the text?</h2>
     It wasn't printed to the screen as before because we sent that text to the file. Only by executing that file using the cat command will the txt be outputted.<br>
<h2>7.1 How does the ls command differ from the tree command?</h2>
The ls command shows the directory hierachy in quick efficient manner. The tree command shows an actual structure.<br>
<h2>7.2 How do you choose to use one over the other?</h2>
     We choose the command based off what we want to achieve. If we want to see a full overview of the directories and all their relationships then we'll use tree.<br>
<h2>8.1 What do you think the argument to sleep specifies?</h2>
     The argument to sleep specifices how many seconds it will take for a command to return<br>
<h2>8.2 Are you able to prove your hypothesis? How?</h2>
     I can prove my hypothesis by typing sleep 10 and determining how many seconds it takes to return<br>
<h2>9.1 How is the behavior different from what you expected?</h2>
     The behavior is different what I expected because of 10 seconds, it took a whole minute for the command to return.<br>
<h2>9.2 What do you think it means to run a job in the background?</h2>
     Running a job in the background means allowing a process to run without sending any messages to the main screen.<br>
<h2>10.1 What do you think the numbr displayed in the brackets specifies?</h2>
     When I execute the jobs command it shows the list of all current jobs.<br>
<h2>What did I learn? What is the big idea?</h2>
    I learned several things about Tabby's functionality and keybinds that will make navigation and workflow much more efficient. The big idea is that mastering Tabby will de\
pend on practice, repetition until muscle memory is created.<br>
<h2>What challenges did I encounter</h2>
    Some challenges I encountered were remembering keybinds especially when I was unfamiliar with some of these. For example the paste and copy commands in tabby were not what I'm accustomed to.<br>
<h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    There isn't really anything to improve because I found the tabby tutorial very beginner friendly and easy to follow along. Furthermore, the tutorial actively encourages the programmer to apply what they've learned so they don't forget it.<br>
<h2>Free Reflection</h2>
    Everything I just learned changed my way of thinking about programming. I learned that the best way to program is to find workarounds and shortcuts that will make things \
more efficient instead of working harder. <br>
