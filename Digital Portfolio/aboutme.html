	<h2 style="font-size:40px; text-transform:uppercase class="name";>About Me</h2>
	<h3 style="font-size:19px";>The purpose of this page to is to provide inight into my skills and interests.</h3>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h4 style="font-size: 43px";>Skills:</h4>
	<p>
	  <span>Audio Engineering</span> - I have about five months of experience in working with digital audio work stations and have fundamental knowledge about compression, mixing and mastering, and sound design. I'm currently learning mixing and mastering tracks from sources such as Youtube or asking my producer friends for advice. This is because having these skills can be extremely beneficial since many music producers require mixing and mastering services and I can easily make money by selling my skills.<br>
	  <br>
	  <span>Music Composing and Production</span> - Experience using DAWS, primarily FL Studio, to arrange and master original music in genres such as trap, orchestra, and acoustic. I take alot of inspiration of Joe Hisaishi who is a Japanese composer known for his soundtracks in films like Spirited Away and Howls Moving Castle. Part of the reason I learned piano was because I was inspired by his music<br>
	  <br>
	  <span>Self Taught Music Theory and Piano Experience</span> - I have about two years of experience in piano and possess intermediate music theory knowledge. Furthermore I have developed my ear to the point of instant relative pitch and am capable of playing most songs on the piano within minutes of listening to them. This ability can be useful in several musical environments; for example if I had the chance to accompany an orchestra or band, all I need to do is listen to the other instruments and I would be able to compliment them without having to rely on sheet music. I feel that musicians these days, especially those that received formal education rely too much on sheet music to songs. It take away from their creative liberty and forces them to play a certain way and in the style of the arranger. While I agree that being able to read sheet music is highly beneficial, it's more important to have listening and improvising skills that are just as adequate since music is about being creative<br>
	  <br>
	  <span>Sheet Music Transcription</span> - This is something I don't do as often anymore but I can write sheet music using my ability to hear songs and play it on piano. For example, if there was a song that somebody wanted to play and they learn only  by reading sheet music, I can write it for them after figuring out the notes of the song. Typically I use a program called MuseScore and have only done this a couple of times but it's a skill that be useful if I wanted to make some quick money by selling sheets to people that want to play their favorite songs<br>
	  <br>
	  <span>Video Editing</span> - I have experience editing videos with Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects. During the pandemic, I taught myself how to use these programs to a certain extent because my friends wanted their video game recordings to be edited. 
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <span>Photo Editing and Manipulation</span>- I have beginner experience using photo editing softwares such as Photoshop and Lightroom since I wanted to edit photos that a friend had taken; I also compliment this with a decent understanding of color grading and color theory.<br>
	  <br>
	  <span>Typing Speed</span>- I can type up to 145-170WPM consistently with decent accuracy, although it depends on the content and the website I'm typing on. 
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <span>Blender</span>- In the past I've made several projects using Blender, which is a 3D rendering software used by many content creators and professionals. I haven't made many projects recently but I'm thinking of relearning this skill because it can be useful for frontend development, especially if I want to make my own designs or 3D logos. The main reason I learned this was because my music producer friend wanted an album cover and I thought about using Blender to make part of it, but ended up just learning it for fun. Some of my past work can be found on the Miscellaneous page.<br><br>
	  <span>Web Development</span> - I came into CS1 with little experience coding, but through making this digital portfolio I was able to grasp the basics of HTML and CSS and hope I can continue learning.

	<h4 style="font-size: 43px";>Interests and Background</h4>
	<p>I lived in New York City until my Junior Year of High School when I was forced to move to Dallas in March 2022 due to personal circumstances. I attended an International Baccalaurette school in Staten Island. I attended Allen for the last few months of my junior year, so technically this is my first full year of high school. 
	  Some of my interests include music production and composition, more specfically that of orchestral soundtracks. I enjoy learning the process that goes in the minds of expert music producers such as Alex Moukala and trying to implement their skillsets and techinques to my own repetoire.<br> This <a href="https://streamable.com/nil1y4">link</a> is one of the songs I've produced for a friend's video game. Although music production is solely a hobby, I wouldn't mind making soundtracks for movies or video games on the side if the opportunity presents itself. <br> Furthermore I have a keen interest in sports science and powerlifting. I enjoy reading and watching/reading content about sports specific training. Two of my favorite creators are Isaiah Rivera and PJ Performance because their channels are extremely educational on the topic of sports science and they document some of the elite training methods that professional athletes undergo. I also like watching and analyzing College, NBA, and overseas/professional basketball and discussing/debating with friends.<br><br>
	  I play piano often. I'm been self taught for two years and have not received any formal training. However I could say that the most distinguishing quality about my playing is that I can listen to songs from all genres (except classical)  and immediately identify the chords, melody, and baseline allowing me to play it on the piano. Over the past months I've decreased the time that I can learn a song to less than 2 minutes. My goal is to improve this ability to the point that it's instantaneous. I've trained this ability for the past year or so and I was inspired by a youtuber named Frank Tedesco who was capable of playing songs on piano that he's never heard before and I decided I wanted to be able to do the same thing. It was extremely difficult at first because just like any skill, it takes time and exposure to different genres of music to eventually be bale to identify notes and chords by ear. I'm still refining this skill  but it's something that I'm proud of and sure will be a very useful skill if the time calls for it. For example if I ever wanted to work as a piano accompaniest as a side gig I would be able to compliment the singers/band quickly and efficiently.<br> <br>
	  Another notable interest I have is powerlifting. I started getting going to the gym around the time I moved to Dallas in March 2022 and have increased my lifts to a 275 pound squat and a 340 deadlift weighing 133 pounds. I'm especially starting to research olympic lifting such as power cleans as these are movements I eventually want to become proficient in. My fitness goals revolve around becoming very athletic, strong, and jumping high because I plan on running track in college.<br><br>

	  <h4 style="font-size:43px";>Other facts/Information</h4>
	<p>
	  - My first language is Filipino/Tagalog
	  <br>-I played JV/varsity basketball as a freshman and sophomore for my old high school, Curtis. I was the sixth man of the team but unfortunately I had to move in the beginning of my junior year.<br>
	  <br>-I tried learned guitar without tutorials just by associating each fret with a piano key but eventually realized this was a mistake because I ended up developing bad hand technique <br>
