<br><br><br><br>	<h1>Why?</h1>
	<p class="hover">This <span>Digital Portfolio</span> is important for several reasons. Foremost, it taught me so many HTML and CSS techniques that I would never have learned without actually applying them. I knew nothing about CSS before making this portfolio, but after attempting to make portfolio with no experience, I learned more than I thought I could. I would look at guides in w3schools and constantly look up CSS properties that were new to me and then applied them to my portfolio so that I could reinforce it into my brain. If there's any proof of my progress over the past few weeks, it's the difference between my <a href="CS-I/Journals/J1002.html" id="J1002">J1002 Journal</a> and this website. It's also important because it gives me an opportunity to display my skills and background information; since this is for an assignment for a class I can treat it as informal. However, creating this portfolio gives me the experience to make a formal and professional resume/website if the time calls for it. Furthermore it gives me another place to store information from my resume if I need it in the future</p>
